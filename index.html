    <h2 class="pt-5">The origins of croissant</h2>
    <p>
      The kipferl, the origin of croissant, can be dated back to at least the
      13th century in Austria, and came in various shapes. The birth of the
      croissant itself—that is, its adaptation from the plainer form of kipferl,
      before the invention of viennoiseries—can be dated to at least 1839 (some
      say 1838) when an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a
      Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de Richelieu in
      Paris. This bakery, which served Viennese specialties including the
      kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French
      imitators (and the concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie, a
      20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries). The French
      version of the kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant) shape and
      has become a universally identifiable shape across the world.
